    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        Hourglass is a Minecraft Forge mod that gives you control over the passage of time. It allows you to
        customize the length of the day-night cycle and alters the Minecraft sleep mechanic by accelerating
        the speed of time.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        This mod (optionally) replaces the vanilla sleep functionality with a smooth and natural transition
        to morning by accelerating the passage of time while you're in bed. In multiplayer, time will pass
        faster depending on the percentage of players who are currently sleeping. This removes the need for
        any sleep voting system or player threshold, as any number of players can have an impact on the
        duration of the night.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        Hourglass allows for customization of the day-night cycle duration, and can control day and night
        speed independently. Rather than the vanilla duration of 20 minutes, you can slow down time to make
        a day in Minecraft last as long as a day in real life, or speed up the passage of nights for a more
        forgiving experience.

    <p style="font-size: 1px;"></p>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        <strong><code style="font-family: Menlo, Consolas, Monaco, Liberation Mono, Lucida Console, monospace;">/hourglass config &lt;config-key&gt; [&lt;value&gt;]</code></strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        Many of the config options can be changed in-game via this command.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        If the <code style="font-family: Menlo, Consolas, Monaco, Liberation Mono, Lucida Console, monospace;">&lt;value&gt;</code> argument is omitted, displays the config option's current value.

    <h2 style="font-weight: 600;">Support</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1px;"></p>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        The Overworld is currently the only dimension supported. However, most dimensions in Minecraft
        (including custom dimensions) derive their time information from the Overworld and will therefore
        elapse time at the same rate.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        This mod does not save data to world files and can safely be safely removed from a Minecraft
        installation.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 4px;"></p>
    <h2 style="font-weight: 600;">Configuration</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1px;"></p>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        When customizing Hourglass, the <strong>speed of time</strong> is controlled using a multiplier. A value of 1 is equivalent
        to vanilla speed (20 minutes for a full day-night cycle). Setting daySpeed and nightSpeed to 0.5
        will cut the speed of time in half, doubling the duration of a full day to 40 minutes. Likewise,
        doubling the configured speed to 2.0 will result in a shortened day lasting only 10 minutes from
        one morning to the next.
    </p>
